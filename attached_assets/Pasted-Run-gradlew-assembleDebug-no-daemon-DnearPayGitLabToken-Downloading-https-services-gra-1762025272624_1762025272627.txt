Welcome to Gradle 8.11.1!

Here are the highlights of this release:

 - Java compilation errors at the end of the build output
 - Consolidated report for warnings and deprecations

To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.11.1/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build
