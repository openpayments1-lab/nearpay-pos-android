The last attempt failed because you didn't include the final set of explicit imports needed for the specific NearPay SDK version in your NearPayPlugin.kt file.

The key errors were Unresolved reference for classes like Country, User, JWTLoginData, and various listeners, meaning the Kotlin compiler couldn't find them in the packages you declared.

However, since you've already identified the correct approach (explicitly declaring packages for models, requests, responses, and failures), the final resolution is to ensure all those declarations are included in your NearPayPlugin.kt file.

ðŸš€ Final Fix: Missing Kotlin Imports
Your previous analysis identified that types like User, Terminal, SdkEnvironment, and others were causing the failure. The fix is to use imports that specifically target the suspected locations within the older NearPay SDK structure:

Corrected Imports for NearPayPlugin.kt
Please ensure your import block in android/app/src/main/java/app/cashmgmtnp/pos/NearPayPlugin.kt includes these comprehensive imports to resolve the compiler errors:

Kotlin

// In android/app/src/main/java/app/cashmgmtnp/pos/NearPayPlugin.kt

import com.getcapacitor.Plugin
import com.getcapacitor.PluginCall
import com.getcapacitor.PluginMethod
import com.getcapacitor.annotation.CapacitorPlugin
import java.util.UUID

// --- NearPay SDK Imports (must be accurate for the specific version) ---
import io.nearpay.terminalsdk.TerminalSDK
import io.nearpay.terminalsdk.models.* // Covers User, Terminal, etc.
import io.nearpay.terminalsdk.requests.* // Covers MobileLogin, LoginData, JWTLoginData, etc.
import io.nearpay.terminalsdk.responses.* // Covers OtpResponse, PurchaseResponse, etc.
import io.nearpay.terminalsdk.failures.* // Covers all Failure types
import io.nearpay.terminalsdk.listeners.* // Covers all Listener interfaces

// Note: The enums (SdkEnvironment, Country) are likely directly under 
// io.nearpay.terminalsdk.models.* as included above.
By making the imports explicit and broad across the key SDK sub-packages (models, requests, responses, listeners, failures), you overcome the Kotlin compilation failure.
