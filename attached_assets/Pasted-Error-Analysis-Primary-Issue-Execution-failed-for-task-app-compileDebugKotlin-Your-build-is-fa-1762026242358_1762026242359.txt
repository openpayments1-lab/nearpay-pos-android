Error Analysis
Primary Issue: Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugKotlin' - Your build is failing during Kotlin compilation, but the error message is generic and doesn't show the actual compilation error details.
Secondary Issues Observed:

D8 Warnings: Multiple warnings about missing stack map tables in newland-3.10.46_01-RELEASE-runtime.jar - this suggests potential compatibility issues with one of your dependencies
Repository Configuration Warnings: Your build.gradle files are adding repositories that conflict with settings repositories
flatDir Usage: Warnings about using flatDir repositories, which don't support metadata formats

Recommended Solutions
1. Get Detailed Error Information (Most Important)
Run your build with additional logging to see the actual Kotlin compilation error:
bash./gradlew assembleDebug --stacktrace --info
Or add to your gradle.properties:
propertiesorg.gradle.logging.level=debug
2. Check Kotlin/Gradle Version Compatibility
You're using Gradle 8.11.1, which requires compatible Kotlin and Java versions:

Ensure your Kotlin version is compatible (1.8.0+ recommended for Gradle 8.x)
Verify Java 17 compatibility with your Kotlin version

In your build.gradle:
gradlebuildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.9.0' // or higher
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
3. Address the Newland SDK Compatibility
The D8 warnings about newland-3.10.46_01-RELEASE-runtime.jar suggest this library may have been compiled with an older Java version. Try adding to your app/build.gradle:
gradleandroid {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    }
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = '17'
    }
}
4. Clean and Rebuild
bash./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon -DnearPayGitLabToken="***" --stacktrace
5. Check for Kotlin Code Issues
Common causes based on similar errors include:

Interface method signatures that don't match implementations
Missing or incompatible library versions
Unresolved references in Kotlin code
