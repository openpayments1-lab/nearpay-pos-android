This new log gives us a crucial piece of information that slightly changes the diagnosis from the previous "401 Unauthorized" error, although it's related to the same dependency download.The key line is that Gradle searched for the dependency in all repositories but ultimately failed to find it.üõë Failure Analysis: Dependency Not FoundThe detailed failure log indicates that the Gradle build process could not find the NearPay SDK (io.nearpay:terminalsdk-release:2.1.91) after searching all configured repositories:> Could not find io.nearpay:terminalsdk-release:2.1.91.
Searched in the following locations:
  - https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/... (Google)
  - https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/... (Maven Central)
  - https://developer.huawei.com/repo/... (Huawei)
  - https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/37026421/packages/maven/... (GitLab)
The fact that the GitLab URL is listed here means one of two things happened:The GitLab Token is Still Invalid (or missing read_package_registry scope): If the token is invalid, GitLab responds with 401 Unauthorized (as seen in the previous log). Gradle interprets this as "The resource is not here," and moves on to the next repository, ultimately reporting "Could not find" the dependency anywhere.The Dependency Path is Wrong in your build.gradle: The NearPay dependency line in your app/build.gradle file might be misspelled, pointing to the wrong version, or pointing to a module name that doesn't exist in that repository.Scenario ComparisonPrevious LogThis LogDiagnosisReceived status code 401 from server: UnauthorizedCould not find io.nearpay:terminalsdk-release:2.1.91.The initial error is still authentication, leading to a "Not Found" result.üõ†Ô∏è Action Plan: Authentication and Dependency CheckSince the mechanism for passing the token looks correct, the problem is most likely still the token's value or scope, but we should check the dependency line as well.1. Re-Verify the GitLab Token (Highest Priority) üîëAs detailed before, this is the most likely cause. Please ensure your NEARPAY_GITLAB_TOKEN secret in GitHub:Is correct: The value is the exact Personal Access Token from GitLab.Has the correct scope: It must include the read_package_registry permission. Without this, every attempt to download the package will result in a 401 Unauthorized rejection.2. Check the Dependency Line in app/build.gradle (Required)If you have verified the token is 100% correct, the issue might be a simple typo in the dependency declaration.Please locate the dependencies block in your android/app/build.gradle file and provide the line that includes the NearPay SDK:Groovy// Example of what I need to see from your app/build.gradle:
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies
    implementation 'io.nearpay:terminalsdk-release:2.1.91' // <-- Confirm this exact line is correct
    // ...
}
Once you can confirm the token is valid with the correct permissions and confirm the exact dependency line, we should be able to resolve this failure.
