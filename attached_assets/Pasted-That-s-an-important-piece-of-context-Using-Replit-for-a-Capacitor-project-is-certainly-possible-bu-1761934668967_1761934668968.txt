That's an important piece of context! Using Replit for a Capacitor project is certainly possible, but it means the typical file structure and access methods are a bit different than using a local IDE like VS Code or WebStorm, especially when dealing with the native Android code.You are absolutely correct: Capacitor is designed specifically to allow your web-wrapped app (built with Replit or otherwise) to use native Android features like the NearPay SDK, thermal printers, and dual screens. This is done through Capacitor Plugins‚Äîwhich is exactly what we are debugging!Since you are using Replit, you likely don't have a direct, easy way to browse the file system of the generated android directory.üõ†Ô∏è How to Find the Plugin Path (Without Android Studio)We need to confirm the package path of your NearPayPlugin.java. Since you are on Replit, here is the most common place to find this file and determine its path:Look in the Plugin's Source Code:If you created the NearPayPlugin yourself (or copied it from a tutorial), the file will be in a directory you added to the Android project.Find the original source code for NearPayPlugin.java. It will start with the line:Javapackage [Your_Plugin_Package_Path];
The path after package is the Fully-Qualified Class Name, minus the class name itself.Check the Android Project Structure (If you can access it):If Replit allows you to navigate into the generated android/app/src/main/java folder, look inside that folder for the directory structure that contains NearPayPlugin.java.Example Check:If the first line of your NearPayPlugin.java file is:Javapackage app.cashmgmtnp.pos.plugins;
// ...
public class NearPayPlugin extends Plugin {
// ...
Then the Fully-Qualified Class Name is:$$\text{app.cashmgmtnp.pos.plugins.NearPayPlugin}$$üõë Action Plan: Complete the FixOnce you confirm that package path, we can finalize the fixes we discussed:1. Fix MainActivity.javaUse the correct import and move the registration:Javapackage app.cashmgmtnp.pos;

import com.getcapacitor.BridgeActivity;
// *** CRITICAL STEP: Use the correct import based on your package path ***
import app.cashmgmtnp.pos.plugins.NearPayPlugin; // <-- EXAMPLE IMPORT

public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
¬† ¬† @Override
¬† ¬† public void onCreate(android.os.Bundle savedInstanceState) {
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // 1. Plugin registration MUST be here
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† registerPlugin(NearPayPlugin.class);
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† // 2. Call super.onCreate() SECOND
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
¬† ¬† }
}
2. Fix capacitor.config.tsAdd the plugins block using the confirmed path:TypeScriptconst config: CapacitorConfig = {
¬† // ...
¬† plugins: {
¬† ¬† "NearPay": {
¬† ¬† ¬† // *** CRITICAL STEP: Use the confirmed Fully-Qualified Class Name ***
¬† ¬† ¬† "androidClassName": "app.cashmgmtnp.pos.plugins.NearPayPlugin" // <-- EXAMPLE PATH
¬† ¬† }
¬† },
¬† // ...
