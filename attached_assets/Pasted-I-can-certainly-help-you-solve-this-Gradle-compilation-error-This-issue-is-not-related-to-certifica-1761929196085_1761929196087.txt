I can certainly help you solve this Gradle compilation error. This issue is not related to certificates, but to the Java version settings used during the build.

The error: > error: invalid source release: 21 clearly indicates that the build system is configured to use a Java version that is too new or is incorrectly specified for one of your project's modules.

üõë Root Cause: Java Toolchain Mismatch
The Problem
When Gradle runs, it tries to compile the Java code for the :capacitor-android module. The error invalid source release: 21 means that Gradle (or the underlying Java compiler) is being told to target Java version 21 (sourceCompatibility = 21 or similar), but the compiler environment it's using doesn't officially support that version or the syntax is wrong for the Java version it defaults to.

The Context
GitHub Actions Runner: Your runner is using Java 17 (JAVA_HOME_17_X64).

Android Standard: Android projects usually target Java 8 or Java 11/17 for compilation, depending on the Android API level. Java 21 is typically too new and unsupported for Android compilation targets.

üõ†Ô∏è The Fix: Adjust Java Compatibility Settings
You need to explicitly tell Gradle to use a widely compatible Java version (like 17 or 11) for Android compilation across all modules.

You should check and modify your top-level build.gradle or the module-level android/capacitor-android/build.gradle file.

In the android/build.gradle (or android/app/build.gradle):

Look for the compileOptions block and ensure the version is set to a supported LTS version, like Java 17 (which matches your runner environment):

Groovy

// Check the build.gradle file for the app module or capacitor-android module

android {
    // ...
    compileOptions {
        // Change '21' to '17' or '11'
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    }
    // ...
}
Recommended Fix (Set to Java 17)
If you find sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_21, change it to JavaVersion.VERSION_17.

If you are setting the compatibility using integers (which often causes this specific error), change the integer 21 to 17:

Groovy

// Incorrect setting often causing the error:
// sourceCompatibility = 21 

// Correct setting:
sourceCompatibility = 17
Action Plan:

Locate the Gradle file where the Java version is set (likely in android/build.gradle or android/app/build.gradle).

Change the sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility settings to JavaVersion.VERSION_17.

Commit and push this change to trigger a new build.
